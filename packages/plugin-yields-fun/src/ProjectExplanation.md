# Solana Yields Fun - AI Agent Plugin

## Overview

This project implements an AI agent system designed to autonomously evaluate and interact with DeFi opportunities on the Solana blockchain. The agent combines natural language processing, market analysis, and protocol-specific knowledge to make intelligent decisions about yield opportunities.

## AI Agent Architecture

### Core AI Components

1. **Natural Language Understanding**

    - Processes user queries about yield opportunities
    - Interprets market sentiment and trading signals
    - Translates complex DeFi concepts into actionable insights

2. **Evaluator System**

    - Autonomous yield opportunity evaluation
    - Risk assessment through pattern recognition
    - Dynamic strategy adjustment based on market conditions
    - Trust scoring for protocols and tokens

3. **Memory Management**
    - Persistent state tracking across sessions
    - Historical performance analysis
    - Learning from past recommendations
    - Pattern recognition for market behavior

### Agent Capabilities

1. **Autonomous Analysis**

    - Protocol health assessment
    - Yield opportunity discovery
    - Risk-reward optimization
    - Market timing signals

2. **Intelligent Decision Making**

    - Position sizing recommendations
    - Entry/exit timing
    - Risk management parameters
    - Portfolio rebalancing signals

3. **Protocol Interaction**
